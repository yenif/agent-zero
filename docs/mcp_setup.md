# Agent Zero: MCP Server Integration Guide

This guide explains how to configure and utilize external tool providers through the Model Context Protocol (MCP) with Agent Zero. This allows Agent Zero to leverage tools hosted by separate local or remote MCP-compliant servers.

## What are MCP Servers?

MCP servers are external processes or services that expose a set of tools that Agent Zero can use. Agent Zero acts as an MCP *client*, consuming tools made available by these servers. The integration supports two main types of MCP servers:

1.  **Local Stdio Servers**: These are typically local executables that Agent Zero communicates with via standard input/output (stdio).
2.  **Remote SSE Servers**: These are servers, often accessible over a network, that Agent Zero communicates with using Server-Sent Events (SSE), usually over HTTP/S.

## How Agent Zero Consumes MCP Tools

Agent Zero discovers and integrates MCP tools dynamically:

1.  **Configuration**: You define the MCP servers Agent Zero should connect to in its configuration. The primary way to do this is through the Agent Zero settings UI.
2.  **Saving Settings**: When you save your settings via the UI, Agent Zero updates the `tmp/settings.json` file, specifically the `"mcp_servers"` key.
3.  **Automatic Installation (on Restart)**: After saving your settings and restarting Agent Zero, the system will attempt to automatically install any MCP server packages defined with `command: "npx"` and the `--package` argument in their configuration (this process is managed by `initialize.py`). You can monitor the application logs (e.g., Docker logs) for details on this installation attempt.
4.  **Tool Discovery**: Upon initialization (or when settings are updated), Agent Zero connects to each configured and enabled MCP server and queries it for the list of available tools, their descriptions, and expected parameters.
5.  **Dynamic Prompting**: The information about these discovered tools is then dynamically injected into the agent's system prompt. A placeholder like `{{tools}}` in a system prompt template (e.g., `prompts/default/agent.system.mcp_tools.md`) is replaced with a formatted list of all available MCP tools. This allows the agent's underlying Language Model (LLM) to know which external tools it can request.
6.  **Tool Invocation**: When the LLM decides to use an MCP tool, Agent Zero's `process_tools` method (handled by `mcp_handler.py`) identifies it as an MCP tool and routes the request to the appropriate `MCPConfig` helper, which then communicates with the designated MCP server to execute the tool.

## Configuration

### Configuration File & Method

The primary method for configuring MCP servers is through **Agent Zero's settings UI**.

When you input and save your MCP server details in the UI, these settings are written to:

*   `tmp/settings.json`

### The `mcp_servers` Setting in `tmp/settings.json`

Within `tmp/settings.json`, the MCP servers are defined under the `"mcp_servers"` key.

*   **Value Type**: The value for `"mcp_servers"` must be a **JSON formatted string**. This string itself contains an **array** of server configuration objects.
*   **Default Value**: If `tmp/settings.json` does not exist, or if it exists but does not contain the `"mcp_servers"` key, Agent Zero will use a default value of `""` (an empty string), meaning no MCP servers are configured.
*   **Manual Editing (Advanced)**: While UI configuration is recommended, you can also manually edit `tmp/settings.json`. If you do, ensure the `"mcp_servers"` value is a valid JSON string, with internal quotes properly escaped.

**Example `mcp_servers` string in `tmp/settings.json`:**

```json
{
    // ... other settings ...
    "mcp_servers": "[{\\\"name\\\": \\\"sequential-thinking\\\",\\\"command\\\": \\\"npx\\\",\\\"args\\\": [\\\"--yes\\\", \\\"--package\\\", \\\"@modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking\\\", \\\"mcp-server-sequential-thinking\\\"]}, {\\\"name\\\": \\\"brave-search\\\", \\\"command\\\": \\\"npx\\\", \\\"args\\\": [\\\"--yes\\\", \\\"--package\\\", \\\"@modelcontextprotocol/server-brave-search\\\", \\\"mcp-server-brave-search\\\"], \\\"env\\\": {\\\"BRAVE_API_KEY\\\": \\\"YOUR_BRAVE_KEY_HERE\\\"}}, {\\\"name\\\": \\\"fetch\\\", \\\"command\\\": \\\"npx\\\", \\\"args\\\": [\\\"--yes\\\", \\\"--package\\\", \\\"@tokenizin/mcp-npx-fetch\\\", \\\"mcp-npx-fetch\\\", \\\"--ignore-robots-txt\\\", \\\"--user-agent=Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/123.0.0.0 Safari/537.36\\\"]}]",
    // ... other settings ...
}
```
*Note: In the actual `settings.json` file, the entire value for `mcp_servers` is a single string, with backslashes escaping the quotes within the array structure.*

*   **Updating**: As mentioned, the recommended way to set or update this value is through Agent Zero's settings UI.
*   **For Existing `settings.json` Files (After an Upgrade)**: If you have an existing `tmp/settings.json` from a version of Agent Zero prior to MCP server support, the `"mcp_servers"` key will likely be missing. To add this key:
    1.  Ensure you are running a version of Agent Zero that includes MCP server support.
    2.  Run Agent Zero and open its settings UI.
    3.  Save the settings (even without making changes). This action will write the complete current settings structure, including a default `"mcp_servers": ""` if not otherwise populated, to `tmp/settings.json`. You can then configure your servers via the UI or by carefully editing this string.

### MCP Server Configuration Structure

Here are templates for configuring individual servers within the `mcp_servers` JSON array string:

**1. Local Stdio Server**

```json
{
    "name": "My Local Tool Server",
    "description": "Optional: A brief description of this server.",
    "command": "python", // The executable to run (e.g., python, /path/to/my_tool_server)
    "args": ["path/to/your/mcp_stdio_script.py", "--some-arg"], // List of arguments for the command
    "env": { // Optional: Environment variables for the command's process
        "PYTHONPATH": "/path/to/custom/libs:.",
        "ANOTHER_VAR": "value"
    },
    "encoding": "utf-8", // Optional: Encoding for stdio communication (default: "utf-8")
    "encoding_error_handler": "strict", // Optional: How to handle encoding errors. Can be "strict", "ignore", or "replace" (default: "strict").
    "disabled": false // Set to true to temporarily disable this server without removing its configuration.
}
```

**2. Remote SSE Server**

```json
{
    "name": "My Remote API Tools",
    "description": "Optional: Description of the remote SSE server.",
    "url": "https://api.example.com/mcp-sse-endpoint", // The full URL for the SSE endpoint of the MCP server.
    "headers": { // Optional: Any HTTP headers required for the connection.
        "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY_OR_TOKEN",
        "X-Custom-Header": "some_value"
    },
    "init_timeout": 5, // Optional: Initial connection timeout in seconds (default: system-wide MCP client init timeout).
    "tool_timeout": 300, // Optional: Timeout for individual tool calls in seconds (default: system-wide MCP client tool timeout).
    "transport": "auto", // Optional: Transport selection. Can be "auto", "streamable-http", or "sse". Default is "auto".
    "disabled": false
}
```

**Remote Server Transport Configuration (`transport` field):**

For remote MCP servers (those configured with a `url`), you can specify the communication transport method using the `transport` field. This field accepts one of three values:

*   `"auto"` (Default): Agent Zero will attempt to auto-detect the best transport. If the server `url` does not contain `/sse/` (case-insensitive), it will use the **Streamable HTTP** transport. If `/sse/` is found in the URL, it will fall back to the **SSE** transport.
*   `"streamable-http"`: This forces Agent Zero to use the **Streamable HTTP** transport. This is generally recommended for FastMCP servers that support it, as it can offer better performance and compatibility.
*   `"sse"`: This forces Agent Zero to use the **Server-Sent Events (SSE)** transport.

**Example of `transport` field in a remote server configuration:**
```json
{
  "name": "MyRemoteMCPServer",
  "description": "A remote MCP server explicitly using Streamable HTTP",
  "url": "https://example.com/mcp_stream_endpoint", // An endpoint that supports Streamable HTTP
  "transport": "streamable-http",
  "headers": { "X-API-Key": "yourkey" },
  "disabled": false
}
```

**Example `mcp_servers` value in `tmp/settings.json`:**

```json
{
    // ... other settings ...
    "mcp_servers": "[{\\\"name\\\": \\\"MyPythonTools\\\", \\\"command\\\": \\\"python3\\\", \\\"args\\\": [\\\"mcp_scripts/my_server.py\\\"], \\\"disabled\\\": false}, {\\\"name\\\": \\\"ExternalAPI\\\", \\\"url\\\": \\\"https://data.example.com/mcp\\\", \\\"headers\\\": {\\\"X-Auth-Token\\\": \\\"supersecret\\\"}, \\\"disabled\\\": false}]",
    // ... other settings ...
}
```

**Key Configuration Fields:**

*   `"name"`: A unique name for the server. This name will be used to prefix the tools provided by this server (e.g., `my_server_name.tool_name`). The name is normalized internally (converted to lowercase, spaces and hyphens replaced with underscores).
*   `"disabled"`: A boolean (`true` or `false`). If `true`, Agent Zero will ignore this server configuration.
*   `"url"`: **Required for Remote SSE Servers.** The endpoint URL.
*   `"command"`: **Required for Local Stdio Servers.** The executable command.
*   `"args"`: Optional list of arguments for local Stdio servers.
*   Other fields are specific to the server type and mostly optional with defaults.

## Using MCP Tools

Once configured, successfully installed (if applicable, e.g., for `npx` based servers), and discovered by Agent Zero:

*   **Tool Naming**: MCP tools will appear to the agent with a name prefixed by the server name you defined (and normalized, e.g., lowercase, underscores for spaces/hyphens). For instance, if your server is named `"sequential-thinking"` in the configuration and it offers a tool named `"run_chain"`, the agent will know it as `sequential_thinking.run_chain`.
*   **Agent Interaction**: You can instruct the agent to use these tools. For example: "Agent, use the `sequential_thinking.run_chain` tool with the following input..." The agent's LLM will then formulate the appropriate JSON request.
*   **Execution Flow**: Agent Zero's `process_tools` method (with logic in `python/helpers/mcp_handler.py`) prioritizes looking up the tool name in the `MCPConfig`. If found, the execution is delegated to the corresponding MCP server. If not found as an MCP tool, it then attempts to find a local/built-in tool with that name.

This setup provides a flexible way to extend Agent Zero's capabilities by integrating with various external tool providers without modifying its core codebase.
