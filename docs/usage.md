  - Files are listed in the chat input area waiting to be sent

![File Attachments](res/ui-attachments.png)

#### Working with Attached Files
* Files can be referenced directly in your messages
* Agent Zero can:
  - Process attached files
  - Move files to specific directories
  - Perform operations on multiple files simultaneously
  - Confirm successful file operations with detailed responses

![Working with Attachments](res/ui-attachments-2.png)

> [!TIP]
> When working with multiple files, you can attach them all at once and then give instructions about what to do with them. The agent will handle them as a batch while keeping you informed of the progress.

## Tool Usage
Agent Zero's power comes from its ability to use [tools](architecture.md#tools). Here's how to leverage them effectively:

- **Understand Tools:** Agent Zero includes default tools like knowledge (powered by SearXNG), webpage content, code execution, and communication. Understand the capabilities of these tools and how to invoke them.

## Example of Tools Usage: Web Search and Code Execution
Let's say you want Agent Zero to perform some financial analysis tasks. Here's a possible prompt:

> Please be a professional financial analyst. Find last month Bitcoin/ USD price trend and make a chart in your environment. The chart must  have highlighted key points corresponding with dates of major news  about cryptocurrency. Use the 'knowledge_tool' to find the price and  the news, and the 'code_execution_tool' to perform the rest of the job.

Agent Zero might then:

1. Use the `knowledge_tool` to query a reliable source for the Bitcoin price and for the news about cryptocurrency as prompted.
2. Extract the price from the search results and save the news, extracting their dates and possible impact on the price.
3. Use the `code_execution_tool` to execute a Python script that performs the graph creation and key points highlighting, using the extracted data and the news dates as inputs.
4. Return the final chart that you'll find in `/work_dir`, responding to the user with the `response_tool`.

> [!NOTE]
> The first run of `code_execution_tool` may take a while as it downloads and builds the Agent Zero Docker image. Subsequent runs will be faster.

This example demonstrates how to combine multiple tools to achieve an analysis task. By mastering prompt engineering and tool usage, you can unlock the full potential of Agent Zero to solve complex problems.

## Multi-Agent Cooperation
One of Agent Zero's unique features is multi-agent cooperation.

* **Creating Sub-Agents:** Agents can create sub-agents to delegate sub-tasks.  This helps manage complexity and distribute workload.
* **Communication:** Agents can communicate with each other, sharing information and coordinating actions. The system prompt and message history play a key role in guiding this communication.
* **Hierarchy:** Agent Zero uses a [hierarchical structure](architecture.md#agent-hierarchy-and-communication), with superior agents delegating tasks to subordinates.  This allows for structured problem-solving and efficient resource allocation.

## Prompt Engineering
Effective prompt engineering is crucial for getting the most out of Agent Zero. Here are some tips and techniques:

* **Be Clear and Specific:** Clearly state your desired outcome.  The more specific you are, the better Agent Zero can understand and fulfill your request.  Avoid vague or ambiguous language.
* **Provide Context:** If necessary, provide background information or context to help the agent understand the task better. This might include relevant details, constraints, or desired format for the response.
* **Break Down Complex Tasks:**  For complex tasks, break them down into smaller, more manageable sub-tasks.  This makes it easier for the agent to reason through the problem and generate a solution.
* **Iterative Refinement:** Don't expect perfect results on the first try.  Experiment with different prompts, refine your instructions based on the agent's responses, and iterate until you achieve the desired outcome. To achieve a full-stack, web-app development task, for example, you might need to iterate for a few hours for 100% success.

## Voice Interface
Agent Zero provides both Text-to-Speech (TTS) and Speech-to-Text (STT) capabilities for natural voice interaction:

### Text-to-Speech
Enable voice responses from agents:
* Toggle the "Speech" switch in the Preferences section of the sidebar
* Agents will use your system's built-in voice synthesizer to speak their messages
* Click the "Stop Speech" button above the input area to immediately stop any ongoing speech

![TTS Stop Speech](res/ui-tts-stop-speech.png)

- The interface allows users to stop speech at any time if a response is too lengthy or if they wish to intervene during the conversation.

The TTS uses a standard voice interface provided by modern browsers, which may sound robotic but is effective and does not require complex AI models. This ensures low latency and quick responses across various platforms, including mobile devices.


> [!TIP]
> The Text-to-Speech feature is great for:
> - Multitasking while receiving agent responses
> - Accessibility purposes
> - Creating a more interactive experience

### Speech-to-Text
Send voice messages to agents using OpenAI's Whisper model (does not require OpenAI API key!):

1. Click the microphone button in the input area to start recording
2. The button color indicates the current status:
   - Grey: Inactive
   - Red: Listening
   - Green: Recording
   - Teal: Waiting
   - Cyan (pulsing): Processing

Users can adjust settings such as silence threshold and message duration before sending to optimize their interaction experience.

Configure STT settings in the Settings page:
* **Model Size:** Choose between Base (74M, English) or other models
  - Note: Only Large and Turbo models support multiple languages
* **Language Code:** Set your preferred language (e.g., 'en', 'fr', 'it', 'cz')
* **Silence Detection:**
  - Threshold: Adjust sensitivity (lower values are more sensitive)
  - Duration: Set how long silence should last before ending recording
  - Timeout: Set maximum waiting time before closing the microphone

![Speech to Text Settings](res/ui-settings-5-speech-to-text.png)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> All STT and TTS functionalities operate locally within the Docker container, 
> ensuring that no data is transmitted to external servers or OpenAI APIs. This 
> enhances user privacy while maintaining functionality.

### Mathematical Expressions
Agent Zero supports KaTeX for beautiful mathematical typesetting:

* **Inline Math:** Use single dollars `$...$` for inline expressions
  - Example: Type `The area of a circle is $A = Ï€r^2$`
  - Renders as: The area of a circle is $A = Ï€r^2$

* **Display Math:** Use double dollars `$$...$$` for centered display equations
  - Example: Type `$$F = G\frac{m_1m_2}{r^2}$$`
  - Renders as a centered equation

![KaTeX](res/ui-katex-1.png)

* **Complex Mathematics:** Supports full KaTeX syntax for:
  - Fractions, exponents, and roots
  - Matrices and arrays
  - Greek letters and mathematical symbols
  - Integrals, summations, and limits
  - Mathematical alignments and equations

![KaTeX display](res/ui-katex-2.png)

> [!TIP]
> When asking the agent to solve mathematical problems, it will automatically respond using KaTeX formatting for clear and professional-looking mathematical expressions.
